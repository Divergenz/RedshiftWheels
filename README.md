Simple script for spinning the wheels.

First of all, thanks for checking this out and to Baraphor for allowing this little helper. I just let this run through my 150 platinum and 60 rift wheel token and it worked fine. 
I wrote this for players with alot of coins, that don't like sitting there brainless and click through the spinning wheels, so i didn't saw the need to collect the rewards for spinning each wheel 20 times. If there is a high demand on this function, i may add it.
Be aware, that this script takes over your mouse, so you can only let it run, if you watch a movie on a second screen or dont use your pc.

Check the Wiki for guides how to setup and how to solve problems, if they should occur.

If there are any other questions, you can contact me in the chat(Divergenz in Room #1) on Kongregate.com, if i am around, i will try to help.
